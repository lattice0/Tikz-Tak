shortdesc Unicode data and loaders for TeX
longdesc This bundle provides generic access to Unicode Consortium data
longdesc for TeX use. It contains a set of text files provided by the
longdesc Unicode Consortium which are currently all from Unicode 8.0.0,
longdesc with the exception of MathClass.txt which is not currently part
longdesc of the Unicode Character Database. Accompanying these source
longdesc data are generic TeX loader files allowing this data to be used
longdesc as part of TeX runs, in particular in building format files.
longdesc Currently there are two loader files: one for general character
longdesc set up and one for initialising XeTeX character classes as has
longdesc been carried out to date by unicode-letters.tex. The source
longdesc data are distributed in accordance with the license stipulated
longdesc by the Unicode Consortium. The bundle as a whole is co-
longdesc ordinated by the LaTeX3 Project as a general resource for TeX
longdesc users.
